Subsidy.Inc delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income. Accurate income is one of the hardest data to obtain. Subsidy.inc has obtained a large 
authenticated data of 50,000 individuals and wishes to develop an income classifier system for individuals.

Variables: Age, JobType, Education Type, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship status, Race, Gender, Catital gains, Capital Loss, Hours per week at work, native country
Target Cariable: Salary Status (Less than or equal to 50k or more than 50k)

Objective: Simplify the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studied, without sacrificing too much of Accuracy. The system would help subsidy.Inc in 
planning subsidy outlay, monitoring and preventing misuse
